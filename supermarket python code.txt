Scenario:
    
    Madam Rita is a trader. She sells appliances. 
    there are three categories of appliances she sells;
    1. Electronics
    2. Computer systems
    3. Accessories  
    
    she wants to be able to track sales for each category, capturing details of the buyer 
    (name, gender and location and phone number) and date of purchase and amount paid.    
    She wants a python progam that enables her to achieve these and also show who 
    bought what at the end of the day.
    
    Put the record of the customers' details in a tabular form.
    
    
SOLUTION:





#Create a tuple for the category of alliances...

prodCat = ('Electronics', 'Computer_systems', 'Accessories')




#creating a function that will populate the customers' records

custRecords = dict()  #creating an empty dictionary for the customers

salesRecords = dict() #creating an empty dictionary for sales record of customers


def customerRecorder(name, gender, location, phone):
    tempList = [gender, location, phone]
    custRecords[name] = tempList
    
    
    
def salesRecorder(name, date, category, qty, unitprice):
    tempDict = dict()
    totalSales = qty * unitprice
    salesKey = name + '_' + date
    tempList = [date, totalSales]
    tempDict[category] = tempList 
    salesRecords[salesKey] = tempDict
    

#Logic input for customerrecorder function

name = input('Enter name here: ')
gender = input('Enter gender here: ')
location = input('Enter location here: ')
phone = input('Enter phone number here: ')

customerRecorder(name, gender, location, phone)


# logic inputs for sales recorder function

name = input('Enter name here: ')
date = input('Enter date here: ')
category = input('Enter category here: ')
qty = int(input('Enter quantity of items purchased here: '))
unitprice = float(input('Enter unit price of items here: '))

salesRecorder(name, date, category, qty, unitprice)


print(custRecords)
print(salesRecords)






# Further more, let's create a function that will automatically populate the sales and customer records at once

def transactionRecords():
    name = input('Enter name here: ')
    gender = input('Enter gender here: ')
    location = input('Enter location here: ')
    phone = input('Enter phone number here: ')
    date = input('Enter date here: ')
    category = input('Enter category here: ')
    qty = int(input('Enter quantity of items purchased here: '))
    unitprice = float(input('Enter unit price of items here: '))
    
    customerRecorder(name, gender, location, phone)
    
    
    salesRecorder(name, date, category, qty, unitprice)


#let's call the function

transactionRecords()   #this will populate the customers' records and the sales records.

print(custRecords) 
print(salesRecords)


#let's put the customer's details in tabular form

import pandas as pd

custTable = pd.DataFrame()  #creating an empty table



#populating the table with keys and values from the custrecords dictionary

custTable['Customers'] = list(custRecords.keys())
custTable['Items'] = list(custRecords.values())


print(custTable)
